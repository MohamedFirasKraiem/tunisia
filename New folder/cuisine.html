        <h1>Tunisian Cuisine</h1>
        <p>Tunisian cuisine is a vibrant blend of Mediterranean and North African flavors, renowned for its bold spices and rich cultural heritage. At its heart is harissa, a fiery chili paste that adds a kick to countless dishes. The national dish, couscous, features steamed semolina served with vegetables, meats, or fish in a flavorful broth. Brik, a crispy pastry filled with egg, tuna, and herbs, is a street food favorite, while lablabi, a hearty chickpea soup, is a comforting staple. Another iconic dish is mlokhia, a rich stew made with finely ground jute leaves, olive oil, and slow-cooked beef, offering a uniquely earthy flavor. Tunisian sweets like baklava and makroudh, made with honey, almonds, and dates, provide a delightful finish. Influenced by Arab, Berber, and Mediterranean traditions, Tunisian cuisine is a celebration of history and community, offering an unforgettable culinary experience.</p>
